This project is an attempt to bring a biological approach to AI.
Our goal is to generate a framework that encompasses all of the
meaningful properties of neurons (brain cells) and place them in
an architecture where they have the greatest possible freedom to
associate and evolve.
Where similar attempts in the past have simplified many aspects
of the biology, we believe that a complete representation of the
important biology is essential to success.

3) cd elysia

4) git submodule init; git submodule update --init --recursive

5) cd externals/linuxdepends ; make protobuf

6) cd ../../brain/build

7) mkdir osx ; cd osx

8) /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake .. -G Xcode

9) open brain.xcodeproj

10) Go to the Product Menu and select Build

11) Go to the Product Menu and select Run (and authorize Xcode)

and that loads a grid of cells without interconnections and
runs it for some fixed number of cycles and then quits
